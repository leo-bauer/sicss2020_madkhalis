# SICSS 2020 - Madkhalis
Examining Online Radical Discourse in the Civil War Context: The Case of Salafi Madkhalis Discourse in the Libyan Civil War on Twitter

Group Team: Leo Bauer & Bilal Salaymeh

This research is exploratory in nature and considered to be a pilot study for further inquiries. It aims to examine the discourse and narrative of the Salafi Madkhalis in Arabic on social media, in the context of the ongoing Libyan civil war. Through uncovering the discourse of this group, the research aims to answer two sub-questions:

How the Madkhalis frame their political support and what does that tell us about political legitimacy in the context of civil war?

How the Madkhalis frame and describe their enemies/opponents and what that tells us about radicalization discourse in a civil war? (and possible deradicalization)

Method and Limitation
Giving the scope of SICSS and in the light of previous researches that faced challenges with uncovering the discourse of this group in an online setting, this project will utilize the text data obtained from Twitter. However, the research team is fully aware of the limitation of Twitter-based research. The main used social media platform in Libya is Facebook. The group and its members and followers have a limited presence on Twitter. Moreover, neither is there a clear organizational hierarchy, nor official accounts affiliated with the group. Therefore, as a preparation stage, qualitative methods such as interviews and online research were used to determine the potential Madkhalis accounts. Based on the interviews and through using snowballing potential accounts were listed, from which the text were scraped.

The analysis itself revolves around basic text analysis operations such as preparing data for analysis (cleaning), lemmatization, word frequency counts, wordclouds, document feature matrix, term frequency and inversed document frequency (TF-IDF) and more. Overall, this project serves as a reminder that many widespread and essential Python and R packages are not suitable for or need creative workarounds to be able to work with Arabic text.

Next steps for this project will be identifying more accounts, scraping all of their tweets as well as all tweets of the ones we identified so far and conduct further analyses such as dictionary-based text analysis, topic modeling, more precise TF-IDF operations, social network analysis and text network analysis.
